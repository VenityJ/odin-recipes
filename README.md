# odin-recipes

In this project imma use the html skills i learned in this project. Imma be making a recipes page and having 3 differnt recipes. I am fairly confident I can do this and wont take my to long to do. Ill have a self reflaction when im done with it.

This is my self reflaction. I found html to be fairly easy. Not much strangleing on that side of it. But i was having trouble with my git and github. It wasnt letting my push my content for a while and had to go on mulitiple sources to fix it. overall i am fairly confident on this part.
